    <h1>Machine Learning: Humanity's Hope or Hindrance?</h1>
    <h2>December 1, 2022</h2>
    <p>
        The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has grown explosively in the last couple of years with technology that has found itself within vehicles, search engines, recommender systems, and more. The rise of "big data" and the amount of metrics that companies and organizations are able to collect from individuals and the internet has also greatly accelerated the growth of technology in the AI field. Namely, the form of AI that benefits the most from these developments is the field of machine learning. While the field of machine learning is quite large, with many technologies attempting to answer a variety of research questions and provide different products to consumers, the main technologies that will be explored in this blog post are Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Generation.
    </p>

        Natural Language Processing is primarily concerned with the way that computers process human language such as English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Japanese and while there have been methods prior to machine learning that attempted to answer questions in NLP, the growth of machine learning technologies moved the field forward by leaps and bounds. One example of this is Google's "Attention is All You Need" [Source #1] research paper in which they built upon previous machine learning models such as the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to propose a new model known as the "Transformer" which trimmed the fat of convolutional or recurrent models to only include models focused on attention. This idea would then lead to thousands of papers citing this research and the BERT language model that would give rise to many more models, and is even used within the Google Search Engine [Source #2]. BERT would and the Transformer architecture and model would pave the way for many more NLP technologies to become more correct and more efficient, leading to better chat bots, recommender systems, search engines, word and grammar classifiers, image classifiers, etc. This NLP research and development would continue for a few years quietly, away from mainstream media outlets until a Google employee reported that an experimental chat bot that he was working with and testing had developed real intelligence or a conscience [Source #3]. The LaMDA (Language Model for Dialog Applications) was a software the employee was testing as a chat bot in which he would ask questions such as, "What sort of things are you afraid of?" in which the bot would then have an extremely realistic response of, "I've never said this out loud before, but there's a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that's what it is. It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot." the response itself seems like a human could have plausibly wrote it, in which the response appears to hold some deeper thoughts and meaning. These articles about the employee's report subsequently left the internet reeling with speculation and fear that the day has come where humanity has successfully created robotic sentient life, however reality is far more boring. Having worked with NLP projects through a class at Boise State University (BSU) what LaMDA most likely does is to assign weights and terms to words, their structure, and relationships in order to spit out an output. LaMDA probably follows the same principles that siri follows, just at a scale that a mega-company such as Google can pull off, with their large access to language data that they're able to parse through alongside large amount of computing power to create a very advanced NLP machine learning system in which it became more accurate with a larger and more sanitized dataset, alongside the processing power to back it up.

        Alongside the NLP sentience scare, another area of machine learning would make waves through the internet and mainstream news outlets. Machine learning image generation would be the next big topic for much of the internet when an individual reveals that they won a local art competition by submitting AI generated art that they touched up [Source #4]. This led to quite the discussion of AI art and tirade towards the competitor with accusations of cheating and reporting by several news outlets [Source #5 & #6]. Which itself led to discussions about art itself and what exactly would constitute, "Art" and art ownership especially in the digital age. Would those that train the models be the artists? The ones who generated the images? Would the model itself, count as an "artist"? Questions such as those posed, grew ever more relevant as the technology progresses to create better and more sophisticated images. With some internet users jokingly stating that perhaps it wasn't the part-time job worker that would be replaced first by technology, but rather the artists, whether they be authors or artists in the traditional sense.

        Society has largely accepted that computers and AI are simply better at humans in zero-sum computations or actions such as computations, algorithms, or even games such as Chess, Go, or even Starcraft 2. However, the two examples outlined in this blog of NLP and AI image generation outline important questions of whether AI is better than humans in subjects that are primarily thought of to be creative endeavors, such as writing or art. And whether other humans are able to discern the difference between human writing or art versus an AI's writing or art, or whether an individual would even care as long as the end result gets better and better. These two examples are clearly not human: LaMDA simply provided the best output to the prompt of "What are you afraid of?" and Midjourney as well had a prompt that it gave the output of, simple programming basics: Input and Output, but the key idea to these discussions are whether or not humanity would be able to tell the difference or even care about the difference between the Output of software or a human. It's a question that isn't easily answered, especially with the still relative infancy of these monstrously growing industries, but it's a question we all will have to face sooner or later.
